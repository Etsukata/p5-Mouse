Notes for tests

Moose compatibility tests are automatically generated from the
Moose distribution, so you must not edit these tests. Instead
add new tests to t/001_mouse/ or tests about bug reports to
900/mouse_bugs/.

test_status.log indicates the failing test status, and
these failing tests are in t-failing/.
